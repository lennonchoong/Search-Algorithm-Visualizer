## About This Project
This project showcases the visualizations of various search algorithms in pinpointing a selected cell in a 2-dimensional array.

## Usage
#### Running the algorithm
Run the algorithm by either hitting your keyboard's **ENTER** key or press the **Run** button on the top-right corner. 

#### Randomizing grid
Click the **Randomize** button to randomize the cells. Grid randomization is only allowed for algorithms which can search a non-sorted array.

#### Selecting an algorithm
Select from the list of algorithms from the dropdown selection next to **Algorithms**.

#### Changing grid size
Drag the slider next to **Grid Size** to change grid size.

#### Changing run speed
Drag the slider next to **Speed** to change run speed of algorithm.
